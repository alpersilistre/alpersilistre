### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alper Silistre. I am a Software Engineer with a fair amount of experience in Web and Cloud technologies and currently working for Portera as a Solution Architect in Amsterdam, NL.

I have built and worked on many cloud-based web applications; most of them are aligned with .NET technologies. I have extensive Azure and DevOps knowledge from my experience as a developer and cloud engineer.

I have been active in project management and leading projects for our customers in recent years. Having a technical background and first-hand experience in technology projects helps me to guide our partners and stakeholders toward better solutions.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and Computer Applications Master's degree. During my studies, I have published various academic papers in the Software Testing area.
